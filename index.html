        Frida Kahlo (July 6, 1907 - July 13, 1954) was a Mexican artist known for her powerful self-portraits,
        depicting her intense emotional and physical pain. She is celebrated for her unique artistic style, which combines
        elements of realism, symbolism, and surrealism. Kahlo's work often explores themes of identity, gender, and the human
        experience. Despite enduring lifelong health issues following a bus accident in her youth, Kahlo's art remains a
        testament to resilience and creativity.
